# 103ag) Launching your server

With the port forwarding done, people from outside your local network, will now be able to access your server.



### Launching the server

1. Go to the `Skyrim Together Reborn` folder:\
   `C:\Modding\MO2\mods\Skyrim Together Reborn\SkyrimTogetherReborn`
2. Make sure you've configured your `STServer.ini` with a password
3. Open the `SkyrimTogetherServer.exe`
4. Find your **public IPv4** [here](https://icanhazip.com/) or [here](https://www.whatismyip.net/).
5. Give your friend(s) the public IPv4, and tell them to use that to connect to your server.

6\. If your port forwarding has been successful, they should now be able to connect to your server.



### My friends still can't connect to me

I suggest trying the ZeroTier setup instead then. Probably something gone wrong in the port forwarding.



### Onwards to the next step!
