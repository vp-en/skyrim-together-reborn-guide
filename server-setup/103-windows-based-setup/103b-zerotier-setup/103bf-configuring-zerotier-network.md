3. It won't give any installation prompt or instructions.
4. When it's completed, you should now have this ![](https://shx.is/5BE0DjXJn.png) icon in your system tray.

### Joining your network

We need to join your network, when first launching ZeroTier.

1. Find the little ![](https://shx.is/5BE0DjXJn.png) icon in your system tray
2. Right click and select `Join New Network...` \
