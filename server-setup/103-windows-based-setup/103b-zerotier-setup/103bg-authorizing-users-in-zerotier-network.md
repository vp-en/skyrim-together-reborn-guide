6. Write `Host of the Skyrim Together Reborn server` in the `(description)` field
7. Most importantly: Press the `Auth?` checkbox to allow the user to connect to you.

### What IP address should I send to my friend?

1. You should use the `Managed IP` that's beside the `Host`.&#x20;
2. In my case, that would be `10.244.150.2`.&#x20;
3. This is the IP that you would use to connect, using the `Skyrim Together Reborn UI` (STRUI).
