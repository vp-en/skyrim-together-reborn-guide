# 100) Server Setup ReadMe

### Step 100: ReadMe first!

Before we begin the server setup section, we need to prepare a bit.

### Preliminaries

When I write this guide,&#x20;

**I will:**

1. Assume that you've followed every previous step of this guide.
2. Use paths from this guide and this guide only.&#x20;
3. Use MO2 as the mod manager.
4. Try and show you different methods/options on how to host your server.
5. Cover both how to setup your server on a Windows based machine and a Linux (Ubuntu) based machine.
6. Keep being as user-friendly, and try and guide you as to the best of my ability.

**I will not:**

1. Cover how to fix your Vortex setup
2. Cover how to do port-forwarding in any depth, other than to show you how it looks in my personal router setup
3. Offer support in how to fix your router.



### Expectations

1. Hopefully, this will work for the majority of you.
2. But, there's a possibility that it won't work for everyone.
3. Everyone's system is different in some way, which means I can't possibly help everyone.
4. I expect that you read this guide as thoroughly as you can.



### With that being said, let's go :thumbsup:
