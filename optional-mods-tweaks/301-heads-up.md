# 301) Heads up!

### Heads up!

Before you continue with this step, please by wary, that by the time of writing, I haven't actually tested this with other players.

Also be wary that mod support can be weird with Skyrim Together Reborn, even if all of the players have exactly the same mods. Again, refer to [this](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-can-i-use-other-mods-with-this-mod) and [this](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-will-x-mod-work-with-this-mod) about how mods work in Skyrim Together Reborn.

For a list of currently tested mods, you can check out [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/Mod-Compatibility/issues).

But it is **untested** and I **can not confirm** if it will work or not.

With that being said, I'll hopefully be able to test it in the near future.

#### Things be cautious about

* The BethINI application will have a toggle named `Lock Framerate` that is Enabled by default by Bethesda. You can try and remove that toggle, to unlock your framerate (to play above 60FPS), but I'm not sure how that works with Skyrim Together Reborn. So you may try it out at your own risk :thumbsup:
* The USSEP [_should_ work](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/Mod-Compatibility/issues/7), but who knows.

### Onwards to the next step!
