## 202) BethINI tweaks

#### Downloading and extracting BethINI Tweaks

In this step, we'll download a nice little application called `BethINI` that helps configuring SkyrimSE's INI files to unlock the framerate and other nice performance related options.

1. Download BethINI [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4875)
2. Use the `Manual Download` button as before

3\. It'll download a `.zip` file named like `BethINI Standalone Version-4875-3-6-1-1651358897.zip`

4\. Go ahead and extract the file. I'm using `7-zip`.

5\. Right click on the `BethINI Standalone Version-4875-3-6-1-1651358897.zip` file and select `7-Zip --> Extract Here`

7\. Open the newly extracted `BethINI Standalone` folder.

8\. Open the `BethINI.exe`

#### Using BethINI

1. If you have MO2 running in the background, close it for now.
2. Start by selecting `Skyrim Special Edition` from the drop-down list.

4. Press `OK` if you have remembered to close your MO2 instance.
5. Start by selecting your preset (low/medium/high/ultra)
6. Then select `Recommended Tweaks`
7. Adjust the resolution, windowed/borderless (and so on) to your liking.
8. Remove the `V-Sync` toggle. It's better to have enabled in your NVIDIA Control Panel, if you really want it.
9. **OPTIONAL:** You can try and remove the `Lock Framerate` toggle to unlock your framerate beyond 60FPS - but this is **untested!**
