# 003) Launching the game

### Making sure Anniversary Upgrade DLC is disabled

A very important step is to make sure the Anniversary DLC is disabled. You may not have bought it, but it's best to double check it's not there:

1. Open Steam and head to your library.
2. Find `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition`
3. Right-click and select `Properties`
4. Go to `DLC` and **remove** the `âœ“` from the `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Upgrade` DLC.

### Launching the game from Steam

Next thing, we need to launch the game normally from Steam, so that it can generate some config files for us. This is luckily a very simple process.

1. Open Steam and head to your library.
2. Find `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition`
3. Right-click and select `Launch`
4. The SkyrimSE launcher will open and popup with some detection mechanism that _should_ detect your system and set graphic options accordingly.
5. But in my case, it detects everything wrong and will set everything to very low and a wrong resolution.
6. To fix this, head to the `Options` and select `Windowed` and `Borderless` to edit your resolution.
7. From there just set it up as how you'd like.

8\. Now press `Play` and **EXIT THE GAME** after it has opened into the main menu.
