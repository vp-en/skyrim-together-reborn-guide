# ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ Introduction

## Step 000: ReadMe first

Hello there!

This will be a guide that will try and get Skyrim Together Reborn up and running, with only the required mods included. Main reason is, that mods can make things difficult with Skyrim Together Reborn. Refer to [this](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-can-i-use-other-mods-with-this-mod) and [this](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-will-x-mod-work-with-this-mod) for the reasons why.

The **most important thing** is that all your users/friends/players will use the exact same mods in the exact same load order. So if all your players have followed **this guide** and **ONLY** this guide, you should be somewhat fine. But again, refer to [this](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-can-i-use-other-mods-with-this-mod) and [this](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-will-x-mod-work-with-this-mod) - it might not work perfectly.

This guide will try and include as many screenshots and GIFs as possible, and be as user-friendly as possible. This means that it will include all necessary steps to get Skyrim Together Reborn up and running. This also means, that there will be loads and loads of pages. I'll try and divide it into relevant sections.

Whenever the guide refers to "SkyrimSE", it's just short for Skyrim Special Edition.

This guide will probably not be perfect, especially since English is not my first language, and also because I'm forgetful and will probably miss something important.

**Other notes:**

* I use Windows 11. The UI in the screenshots will reflect that.
* I use ModOrganizer2 (MO2) instead of Vortex. I can't deal with the UI of Vortex.
* I will explain how to setup Skyrim Together Reborn as the one who wants to **join a server**, not **host a server**.
* If you need hosting of a server, consider using the free "Skyrim Togehter Reborn" hosting service [PlayTogether](https://playtogether.gg/) by Discord user LordKanelsnegle.
* I will **not** cover how to do server setup(s) for now
* I will **not ever** cover how to do port-forwarding. There are much better resources out there for you to figure that out.

**Credits:**

* I am not affiliated with the official dev team of Skyrim Together Reborn, but all credits of the project of course goes to them. If you need more help, they offer support on their [Discord](https://discord.gg/skyrimtogether).
* Credits also goes to the team behind `A Dragonborn's Fate` [modpack guide](https://dragonbornsfate.github.io).

Good luck!
