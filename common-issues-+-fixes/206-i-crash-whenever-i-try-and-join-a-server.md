# 206) I crash whenever I try and join a server

### Q: I crash whenever I join my friends server, but other people can join it just fine

**A:** You can try enabling `AES-NI` in your BIOS. This is apparently especially relevant for Intel CPUs. This is hard to guide you through, since almost every BIOS looks different.

#### Windows 10

To get to your BIOS, if you're using Windows 10, do the following steps:

1. Go to `Settings`
2. Select `Update and Security`
3. Select `Recovery`
4. Click `Restart`
5. Click `Troubleshoot`
6. Select `Advanced Options`
7. Select `UEFI Firmware Settings`
8. You should now enter your BIOS
9. Use whatever search function you have to find something related to `AES-NI`.
10. You can use the following keywords:\
    `AES`\
    `AES-NI`\
    `Data Protection Technology`\
    `Advanced Encryption Standard`
11. Enable `AES`/`AES-NI`
12. Save your settings and restart your PC - usually use the `F10` key.

#### Windows 11

To get to your BIOS, if you're using Windows 11, do the following steps:

1. Go to `Settings`
2. Select `System`
3. Select `Recovery`
4. Select `Restart now` right beside `Advanced startup`
5. Click `Troubleshoot`
6. Select `Advanced Options`
7. Select `UEFI Firmware Settings`
8. You should now enter your BIOS
9. Use whatever search function you have to find something related to `AES-NI`.
10. You can use the following keywords:\
    `AES`\
    `AES-NI`\
    `Data Protection Technology`\
    `Advanced Encryption Standard`
11. Enable `AES`/`AES-NI`

**A:** Make sure that you're using the right IP address and port when connecting. Trivial thing, but I accidentally miswrote the ip address and that sent me straight to my desktop (CTD).



**A:** Try and delete your INI files from the `My Games\Skyrim Special Edition` folder. Then relaunch SkyrimSE normally through Steam (not through MO2), to let it regenerate the vanilla config files.
