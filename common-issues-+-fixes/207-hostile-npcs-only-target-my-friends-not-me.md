# 207) Hostile NPCs only target my friends, not me

### Q: When we're in combat, the NPCs only target my friends and not me

**A:** That usually happens if you've already killed the mobs in your own savegame. Not sure there's a fix for that.

**A:** Some users have had success with [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2824). Use at your own descretion. Refer to [this](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-can-i-use-other-mods-with-this-mod) and [this](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-will-x-mod-work-with-this-mod) for the reasons why mods can be a bad idea. Current status of it's compatibility can be found [here](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/Mod-Compatibility/issues/41).
