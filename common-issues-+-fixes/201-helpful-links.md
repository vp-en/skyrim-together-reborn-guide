### So now you're in, playing the game. You will probably experience a lot of bugs. Some will be common, some won't.

These next few pages will just be my own personal collection of fixes to common issues, that I've picked up through Discord or GitHub. These fixes have not been tested by me, but have been vouched by other users. With that being said, they might **not** work for you.&#x20;

### The playguide, or, how to play multiplayer Skyrim properly

The Skyrim Together team has created [a playguide](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/playguide) that will walk you through how to do questing properly, and what it means to be a Quest Leader. I think it's pretty clear and concise, about what you can do as a party leader, and what you can do as a party member.
