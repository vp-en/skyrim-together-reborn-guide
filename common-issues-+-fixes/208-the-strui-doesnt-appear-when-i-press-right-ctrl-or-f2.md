# 208) The STRUI doesn't appear when I press RIGHT CTRL or F2

### Q: The STRUI doesn't appear when I press either `Right CTRL` or `F2`

**A:** First, make sure you've followed this guide from A-Z. Then it shouldn't even happen in the first place. Make sure your `Skyrim Together Reborn` mod folder, with the `SkyrimTogehter.exe`, is located at:\
`C:\Modding\MO2\mods\Skyrim Together Reborn\SkyrimTogetherReborn`

**A:** If the UI does not load, or the screen is covered with white boxes when pressing right control, exit to the main menu and load your save again. If that does not work, try restarting your game until it works.

**A:** Try running SkyrimSE in Windowed mode or Windowed Borderless.

**A:** Try restarting your PC. That has worked for some.
