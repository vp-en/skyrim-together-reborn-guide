# 005) Initial MO2 setup

### Opening MO2 for the first time

Opening MO2 for the first time will present you with a window, titled `Creating an instance`. Follow these steps:

1. Press `Next`&#x20;
2. Select `Create a portable instance`
3. Select `Skyrim Special Edition` in the list
4. Just confirm the location is `C:\Modding\MO2` and let the `Show advanced button` stay unchecked. No need to fiddle with that.
5. Press `Next`
6. It will ask for you to link MO2 to your NexusMods account. I highly recommend doing so.
7. Press `Connect to Nexus` and it'll open a browser window.
8. If you're logged in, it'll show this window. If not, log in and it'll show this window. Press `Authorise` to continue.

9\. The confirmation should look something like this:

> Instance type: Portable
>
> Instance location: C:\Modding\MO2
>
> Game: Skyrim Special Edition
>
> Game location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition

10\. Press `Finish` to continue.

11\. A window titled `Show tutorial?` will appear. Just press `No`. We're skipping that for today.

12\. You'll then be met with another window, titled `Register?`. It's asking you if you want MO2 to handle `nxm` links. And that we do want! So press `Yes`

13\. Now it should look like this, and we're ready for the next step.
